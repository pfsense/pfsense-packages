0. WHAT IS IT?

This is a PHP frontend end to vnstat, a network traffic logger.
Since vnstat is console mode only I created this script to
make a 'nice' report of the data collected by vnstat.
For more information about vnstat check out http://humdi.net/vnstat/
For updates to this script check http://www.sqweek.com


1. REQUIREMENTS 

- vnstat setup and collecting data
- webserver with PHP
- php-gd extension installed for PNG graphs


2. INSTALL

Installation should be really straightforward:

Put the files from this package somewhere inside the webroot of
your webserver. Then edit the few configuration options in config.php
to suit your situation and your good to go. The various options are
explained in config.php.
